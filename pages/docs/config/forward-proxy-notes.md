### Forward proxy notes

In order to use SVR.JS as a forward proxy, you need to install forward-proxy-mod SVR.JS mod. [Download this mod.](https://svrjs.org/mods)

If you are using forward-proxy-mod, then local IP addresses and _localhost_ are also accessible from the proxy. You may block these using a firewall, if you don't want these to be accessible from the proxy
